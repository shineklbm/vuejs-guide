## Show/Hide Elements
### v-show
This can be used to show/hide element based on a condition true. Please have a look at the following code.
```
  <div v-show="">This will display only when color value is blue </div>
```
### v-if
This is an alternative to v-show, except it only loads the html elment when the condition is met.
